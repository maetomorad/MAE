				<h2>Sherd Image Viewer and Analysis (ShIVA)</h2>
                <p> ShIVA is a software tool for viewing, manipulating, and extracting qualitative and quantitative data from digital radiographs and tomograms of archaeological materials. The program is written in Interactive Data Langauge (IDL) and is available for download as a freestanding application for use in Apple OSX, Linux, and Microsoft Windows. It relies on the free <a href="http://www.exelisvis.com/Support/HelpArticlesDetail/TabId/219/ArtMID/900/ArticleID/12395/The-IDL-Virtual-Machine.aspx" target="_blank">IDL Virtual Machine</a>, also included in the download package.</p>
                <p>The ShIVA verions available here are configured to output tabular data as text files. If you are interested in using ShIVA with a specific database platform or in concert with MAE's ReArch data management software, please contact us.</p>
